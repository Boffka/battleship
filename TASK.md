Battle ship test task
---------------------
Preferably develop following task in React with TypeScript. Make sure code is posted in gitgub or binbucket public repo.
1) Let's create an onscreen grid of cells aligned within a square 10 by 10.
2) Then we set up initial battle ships - one L shaped, one I shaped and two dot shaped. Initial battleships cannot overlap. Battle ships must not touch one another so there is at least a single cell between them. Any battle ship rotation must be random. Each ship must have outline color defining boundaries of a ship.
3) Start actual game play after any kind of user input which would simulate shots at random positions - any missed shot would indicate already hit area, any shot at any of initial ships would visually indicate that battle ship has sink (change of ship color would be fine enough).
4) Program must be able to tell that all ships have sunk and game is over.
